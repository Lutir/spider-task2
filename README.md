# Spider Inductions Task2
<br>
The main Objective of the task is to make a service that displays some information out of an online API service,<br> in a neat, readable format.<br>
I ve used Git-API For my task<br><br>
The thing ive done here is quite simple-<br>
>User Inputs a <i>git-username</i><br>
>I get this username as input and fetch the <i>lists of repo's</i> created by that user.<br><br>

Main thing we are doing here is <b>Sending a request to server</b>(user sends username). <br>
The <b>server gets the requests and contacts the api</b><br> then <b>The API generates the required response</b> passes it to Server<br> which in turn <b>Processes and gets this info in neat format for the User</b>.
<br><br>

Things remaining to do-<br><br>
>Making a database,in which the server checks for information.If not present there then gets info from API and updates the database.<br>
>Establish a connection to get the info from API to server.<br>
>Basic designing part left.<br>
